    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated to reflect the risk of unjust detention and updates to the Syrian conflict.</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Syria due to the risk of <b>terrorism</b>, <b>civil unrest, kidnapping, hostage taking, armed conflict, and unjust detention.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&#8239;The U.S. government suspended operations in 2012. &nbsp;The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. &nbsp;The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria.&nbsp; Do not travel to Syria for any reason.</p>\n<p>On December 8, 2024, the Assad regime fell, and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) assumed control over much of Syria.&nbsp; Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. &nbsp;No part of Syria is safe from violence. &nbsp;Hostage taking by armed groups, unjust detentions, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, mine fields, and aerial bombardment of civilian centers pose significant risk of death or serious injury. &nbsp;The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country. &nbsp;The interim entities in Syria currently cannot provide even the most routine public services.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. &nbsp;The U.S. government does not support this activity.&nbsp; U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, unjust detentions, injury, or death. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Terrorist groups are active in Syria. &nbsp;Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, IEDs, and assassinations. &nbsp;Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qa&#8217;ida (AQ) affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism or a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.&nbsp; The United States continues to designate Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist group.</p>\n<p>There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. &nbsp;U.S. citizens continue to be targets of abduction and unjust detention by interim entities and other armed groups. &nbsp;Those in detention may not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention. &nbsp;Former Assad regime detention centers were known to be unsanitary facilities where widespread cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of detainees had been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. &nbsp;Detention center conditions under interim entities are unclear but could be harsh and unsanitary. &nbsp;Only Syrian diplomatic missions abroad can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. &nbsp;Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian diplomatic missions could result in detention.</p>\n<p>Due to risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). &nbsp;For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Read the&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SyrianArabRepublic.html\">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Syria.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Syria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website on&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with and respect local laws and customs.&nbsp; Foreign travelers may face increased risk of detention and harassment. <br _rte_temp_br=\"brEOB\">\n</li>\n<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your family, so that if you are taken hostage, your family knows specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive and to rule out a hoax.</li>\n<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones.&nbsp;

    "title": "Yemen - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><i>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits related to terrorism and security</i><b><i>.</i></b><i></i></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Yemen due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;landmines</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy in Sana&#8217;a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Yemen. U.S. citizens should not travel to Yemen for any reason.</p>\n<p>The Department of State has designated Ansarallah (commonly referred to as the Houthis) as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. Other terrorist groups, like Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State affiliates, also plan and carry out attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets, as well as government buildings and facilities. There is also a risk of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminals, and other groups or individuals. Foreign workers and employees may be targeted.</p>\n<p>A civil war continues in Yemen. Even though violence has decreased since a truce in April 2022, instability and fighting are still common, especially along the front lines in central Yemen. Travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities. Foreigners are frequently targets of kidnapping and carjacking, especially outside of urban areas.</p>\n<p>Military conflict has destroyed basic infrastructure like housing, medical facilities, schools, and utilities. This makes it hard to get electricity, clean water, and medical care. Humanitarian groups face obstacles in delivering food, medicine, and water. Landmines are found throughout Yemen.</p>\n<p>Violent and organized crime is common in Yemen. Local law enforcement may not be able or willing to respond to serious crimes.</p>\n<p>Health services in Yemen are poor. There is a re-emergence of diseases like cholera, polio, and measles, which are spreading, especially in Houthi-controlled areas. Medicine and medical supplies are hard to find. Adequate medical treatment is often not available.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens, especially dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens, are at high risk of kidnapping and detention in Yemen. U.S. citizens, particularly young people, may be kidnapped for forced marriage. These often involve family members in the United States and/or Yemen. The Houthis, who control Sana&#8217;a, have detained U.S. citizens, including those with dual citizenship. U.S. citizens, have faced difficulty and delays when trying to leave Yemen.</p>\n<p>Some companies outside Yemen have misrepresented the safety of the Yemeni island of Socotra. They offer tourist trips with unofficial and invalid &quot;visas.&quot; These companies put tourists in danger and legal jeopardy. Only the Republic of Yemen government can issue valid Yemeni visas. The U.S. government cannot assist U.S. citizens in Socotra. Do not travel to Socotra or any part of Yemen.</p>\n<p>Limited commercial flights are available from Aden and Sana&#8217;a to other airports in the region. Check with airlines and travel companies for the latest flight information.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to commercial shipping operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen territorial waters, the Department of Transportation&#8217;s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has issued a Maritime Advisory. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal\">Maritime Administration&#8217;s Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI)</a>.</p>\n<p>The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen&#8217;s ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Yemen should exercise caution.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Yemen.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Yemen.</p>\n<p>If, despite this Travel Advisory, you decide to travel to Yemen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Make contingency plans to leave the country without U.S. government assistance.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Make a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you will be unable to return as planned to the United States.</li>\n<li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li>\n<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>\n<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.

Police and military checkpoints are common and can limit movement. Police may search private homes for weapons. The borders may close without notice.</p>\n<p>Violent crimes like assault, carjacking, home invasion, grenade attacks, and armed robbery are possible.

Emergency medical and fire services are limited or non-existent in some areas of the country. Even relatively minor health problems may necessitate a medical evacuation at the traveler&#8217;s expense. Medical evacuation insurance valid for travel to Burundi is strongly recommended.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout Burundi.

Terrorists and other armed groups have attacked military and civilian targets and represent an ongoing threat to humanitarian aid workers and other NGO personnel operating in DRC.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations are common in many cities and some have turned violent. Police have at times responded with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security conditions.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DemocraticRepublicoftheCongoDRC.html\">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations.</li>\n<li>Use caution when walking or driving.</li>\n<li>Always have a copy of your U.S. passport and DRC visa.

The pedestrian crossing (Erez Crossing) between Gaza and Israel was damaged on October 7 and remains closed, and the pedestrian crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been closed since May 7 and it is unknown when it will re-open. &nbsp;There are sporadic telecommunication and internet outages within Gaza further inhibiting the ability of residents to obtain information.</p>\n<p>If a U.S. citizen, Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), or qualified immediate family member desires our assistance and has not already provided their information to the Department of State, please email U.S. Embassy Jerusalem at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:JerusalemACS@state.gov\">JerusalemACS@state.gov</a>with a copy of the individual&#8217;s travel document as well as an explanation or proof of relationship.</p>\n<p>Visit our website for&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html\">Travel to High Risk Areas</a>.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Gaza:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be prepared for an indefinite stay as the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt can close without advance notice and for long periods during times of unrest and armed conflict.</li>\n<li>Have a plan for entering and departing Gaza that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>\n<li>Households with infants and young children should plan for food and supplies, such as diapers and wipes, formula or baby food, and a change of clothing.</li>\n<li>If you take medication, make sure to have at least five days&#8217; worth at any given time &#8211; if you can, we encourage enough for two weeks beyond your scheduled trip and have a copy of your prescriptions handy.</li>\n<li>If you use assistive or medical devices that require a power supply, be sure to find backup power or other ways that will sustain your device or equipment during a power outage.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>\n<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please be sure to visit our website for&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html\">How to Prepare for a Crisis</a>&#8239;for information that may be helpful.</p>\n<p><b>Israel &#8211; Reconsider Travel (see below for specific advice on travel within 4 kilometers/2.4 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders)</b></p>\n<p>Reconsider travel due to&#8239;<b>terrorism</b>&#8239;and&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>.</p>\n<p>The security situation remains unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire and armed UAV intrusions, often take place without warning.</p>\n<p>U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 11.3 kilometers/seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line; and</li>\n<li>Within 2.4 kilometers/1.5 miles of the Israel-Egypt border.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any official travel of U.S. government personnel within these areas requires approval from the Embassy&#8217;s security office.</p>\n<p>Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.</p>\n<p><b>Northern Israel (within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>\n<p>The Israeli authorities restrict travel to areas close to the border given the Israeli Defense Forces continued presence and activity.</p>\n<p>U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel within 4 kilometers/2.25 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.

    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with updates to reflect the security environment, immigration information, and availability of medical care.</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Afghanistan due to <b>civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b> The U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Multiple terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan and U.S. citizens are targets of kidnapping and hostage-taking. The Taliban have harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers. The activities of foreigners may be viewed with suspicion, and reasons for detention may be unclear. Even if you are registered with the appropriate authorities to conduct business, the risk of detention is high.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Afghanistan. Additionally, Afghan-U.S. citizens and U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) who previously supported the United States (for example, as an interpreter) in Afghanistan may be targeted for detention.</p>\n<p>The Taliban do not regularly permit the United States to conduct welfare checks on U.S. citizens in detention, including by phone. Detention can be lengthy. While in detention, U.S. citizens have limited or no access to medical attention and may be subject to physical abuse.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason, including to accompany eligible family members for relocation. U.S. citizens or LPRs do not have to be physically present in Afghanistan for their qualifying family members to receive such assistance. For further information on how to assist your family members with the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration.html\">immigrant visa application process</a> or to request relocation assistance for family, please refer to our <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/afghanistan-family-reunification/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are urged to depart immediately via commercial means if possible.

The northern part of Cyprus, administered by Turkish Cypriots, proclaimed itself the &#8220;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#8221; (&#8220;TRNC&#8221;) in 1983. The United States does not recognize the &#8220;TRNC,&#8221; nor does any country other than T&#252;rkiye. A buffer zone, patrolled by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, separates the two sides. For U.S. citizen travelers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Enter and exit the island of Cyprus ONLY&nbsp;</b>at Larnaca and Paphos airports or at the seaports of Limassol, Larnaca, and Paphos. The Republic of Cyprus&nbsp;<b>does not consider</b>&nbsp;entry via Ercan Airport or by a seaport in the north to be a legal entrance or departure to Cyprus. U.S. citizens who depart the island from Ercan could have difficulty returning to the Republic of Cyprus in the future.</li>\n<li>You&nbsp;<b>cannot receive a residency permit</b>&nbsp;from the Republic of Cyprus to reside in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots.</li>\n<li>The Republic of Cyprus <b>does not recognize</b>&nbsp;residence permits issued by Turkish Cypriots. If you arrive to the island at a north seaport or Ercan airport or stay in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area for over 90 days, you might be subsequently denied entry into the Republic of Cyprus.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in need of assistance in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots as the government of the Republic of Cyprus does not control the area. Travelers should factor this consideration into their activities in this area.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Across the region, terrorists may attack with little or no warning and may target tourist locations, transportation hubs, shopping areas, places of worship, and government facilities.</p>\n<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) recommending caution for U.S. air carriers and commercial operators operating in the Middle East, including the UAE. For more information, U.S. citizens who plan to travel to the region should check the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions\">FAA&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Residents and visitors should be aware the UAE has strict rules on social behavior, drug possession, traffic violations, and financial crimes. Breaking these rules can lead to arrest and/or an exit ban. U.S. citizens should review the country information page for the UAE to learn about local laws and special circumstances.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/UnitedArabEmirates.html\">Country Information Page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to the United Arab Emirates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>\n<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/\">Facebook&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TravelGov\">X/Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Follow the U.S. Mission to the UAE on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USAinUAE\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/usainuae/\">Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/USAinUAE\">X</a>, and visit the <a href=\"https://ae.usembassy.gov/\">Mission website</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report\">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for the United Arab Emirates.</li>\n<li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list\">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li>\n<li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

ASISTUR works with tourist police (DISETUR) in popular areas like Antigua, Lake Atitl&#225;n, Tikal, Quetzaltenango, Puerto Barrios, and Coban. They also have an emergency call center that speaks both Spanish and English. Tourist groups can request a security escort if they have safety concerns. You can call them anytime by dialing 1500 from a Guatemalan phone number or (502) 2290-2810, and you can also reach them on WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819.</p>\n<p>U.S. government employees and their families cannot travel to the San Marcos Department, Huehuetenango Department, Zone 18 in Guatemala City, or Villa Nueva. They can travel to other parts of Guatemala and visit popular places like Tikal, Antigua, Lake Atitl&#225;n, and the Pacific coast areas in the Santa Rosa and Escuintla. However, they should avoid driving outside Guatemala City at night because of poor lighting and safety risks. They may not use white car taxis or public transportation, like &#8220;chicken buses&#8221; due to the high chance of crime and injury.</p>\n<p>Check the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Guatemala.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for helpful information about traveling to Guatemala.

The paths around the lake can be dangerous and hard to access. Emergency services cannot arrive quickly to help.</li>\n<li>Avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow are very strong, and there are not many lifeguards.</li>\n<li>Never leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and say no to invitations from strangers to private parties.</li>\n<li>Consider staying in hotels that have secure parking, doormen, and professional security staff.</li>\n<li>Use trusted taxi services like Taxis Amarillo Express, Taxi Seguro, or Uber, and only use INGUAT-approved taxis from the &#8220;SAFE&#8221; stand at the airport, hotel taxis, or vetted private drivers. Avoid public transport and white car taxis, as well as &#8220;chicken buses.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Do not hike trails or volcanoes without a qualified local guide, as robberies can happen and getting help can be difficult.</li>\n<li>Avoid using public ATMs, and do not show signs of wealth like wearing expensive watches or jewelry.

Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.</p>\n<p>Commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. Please check flight options at <a href=\"https://www.beirutairport.gov.lb/index.php?lang=en\">Beirut&#8211;Rafic Hariri International Airport</a>. </p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens in Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p>\n<p>Since October 8, 2023, cross-border exchanges of fire have occurred between Hizballah and Israel; in some instances, including targets well north of the border region. A cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon went into effect on November 27 and implementation is ongoing; however, there are continued instances of military activity in some areas of Lebanon. The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning.</p>\n<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p>\n<p>Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated.</p>\n<p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.</p>\n<p>Unexploded landmines and explosive remnants of war are a hazard along the border with Syria. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as these have the potential to turn violent quickly and with little notice. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Lebanon.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Lebanon.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Lebanon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for information on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped, or taken hostage.</li>\n<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li>\n<li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.</li>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>\n<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners.</li>\n<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.</li>\n<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov\">Facebook&nbsp;</a>and<a href=\"https://x.com/TravelGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">&nbsp;X/Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report\">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for Lebanon.</li>\n<li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel\">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li>\n<li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

    "description": "\n<p><i><b>Reissued after periodic review without changes to Level 4: Do Not Travel status.</b></i></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to Belarus</b> due to the Belarusian authorities&#8217; arbitrary enforcement of local laws, the risk of detention, the continued facilitation of Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine, the potential of civil unrest, and&nbsp;the Embassy&#8217;s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Belarus. <b>U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately.</b></p>\n<p>On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk.&nbsp;<b>All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice.</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should try to leave the country as soon as possible and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.</p>\n<p>Belarus does not recognize dual nationality. Belarusian authorities&nbsp;<b>may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals&#8217; U.S. citizenship, and may deny or delay U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals.</b></p>\n<p>Due to Belarusian authorities&#8217; arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the risk of detention, continued facilitation of Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine, and the heightened volatility and unpredictable nature of the regional security environment,&nbsp;<b>do not travel to Belarus</b>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>U.S. citizens are advised to avoid public demonstrations.</b>&nbsp;Authorities have used force to disperse demonstrators, including those peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals,&nbsp;<b>may face the possibility of arrest or detention.</b></p>\n<p>Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored by Belarusian security services. Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices, including information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate possible departure&nbsp;plans in the event of an emergency. Border crossings with neighboring states are sometimes closed with little notice. Additional closures of crossing points along Belarus&#8217; borders with Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and Ukraine are possible.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens and other foreign citizens, for alleged affiliations with opposition parties and alleged participation in political demonstrations, even if there is evidence this affiliation took place outside of Belarus. Approximately 1,300 prisoners are currently jailed for politically-related acts that may not be considered crimes in the United States. The Belarusian government has denied prisoners access to their Embassy and lawyers, restricted communication with family outside prisons, and limited access to information. Conditions in Belarusian detention facilities are extremely poor. U.S. citizens in the vicinity of demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment and/or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities forced the landing of a commercial aircraft transiting Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an Advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating at all altitudes in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV) subject to limited exceptions.

    "title": "Nicaragua - Level 3: Reconsider Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><i><b>Reissued with updates to information on arbitrary enforcement of laws.</b></i></p>\n<p>Reconsider travel to Nicaragua due to&#8239;<b>arbitrary enforcement of laws</b>, <b>the risk of wrongful detention</b>, <b>and limited healthcare availability</b>. Exercise increased caution in Nicaragua due to<b>&#8239;crime</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b> The Government of Nicaragua targets individuals and organizations for political purposes. These include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NGO workers,</li>\n<li>Academics and students,<br>\n</li>\n<li>Business representatives,</li>\n<li>Civil society leaders,<br>\n</li>\n<li>Religious and charity workers (including foreign missionaries),<br>\n</li>\n<li>Journalists,</li>\n<li>And many others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the past year, the Government of Nicaragua has subjected U.S. citizens to arbitrary entry and exit bans, expulsions, arrests, revocations of Nicaraguan citizenship, and other actions.</p>\n<p>The Government of Nicaragua may:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrarily deny entry or re-entry to Nicaragua or departure from Nicaragua to U.S. citizens and Nicaraguan citizens. This includes entry by air or land. Travel refunds are NOT provided in these cases. Denials and exit bans can occur for political reasons. This includes perceived support for or association with those the government disfavors. <b>The government is not required to provide a basis for its denial</b>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Search personal phones, computers, social media accounts, and documents for anti-government content.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Limit photography.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Seize personal devices.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Target individuals for political reasons, regardless of nationality. These can include former allies, political activists, business representatives, religious and charity groups, clergy, missionaries, human rights advocates, civil society leaders, academics, and journalists.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Target pro-democracy advocates and their family members.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Confiscate privately-owned land, residences, financial assets, or personal property. They may do this without warning or due process.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Arbitrarily detain, accuse, and charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, or organized crime offenses. They may do this without fair or transparent processes.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the Government of Nicaragua</b>. U.S. citizens should reconsider travel to Nicaragua, including to work for or volunteer with non-profits or religious organizations. Since 2018, the Government of Nicaragua has closed more than 5,300 civil society organizations, including religious organizations. Nicaraguan security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. This includes dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens. Those arrested can be denied fair and transparent treatment. Convictions routinely occur in non-public trials without adequate defense or credible evidence. Nicaraguan authorities also arbitrarily enforce laws against U.S. citizen religious workers. Nicaraguan authorities have conducted questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens arrested in Nicaragua may be detained for long periods without charges. Judicial processes often lack transparency. This is especially true in politically motivated arrests and property disputes. Political objectives and pressure may affect the willingness of a local attorney to assist and impact the outcomes of legal processes. Prison conditions can be harsh and life-threatening.</p>\n<p>Managua has a sole private hospital that is JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) accredited and certified, with labs and radiology services available, though it has a very limited number of specialists for acute emergencies. Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime. Government hospitals are understaffed and some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies.

Violent gang activity, such as extortion, violent street crime, rape, narcotics, and human trafficking, is widespread. Local authorities may lack sufficient resources to respond effectively to serious crime incidents. Around resort areas in the Bay Islands, which include Roatan, Utila, and Guanaja, there is a concentration of resources, and these areas are better policed.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country and can be about a variety of political or economic issues. Protests, demonstrations, tire burnings, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent.&nbsp;They can shutdown roads and highways, often without prior notice or estimated reopening timelines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In December 2022, the Government of Honduras declared a &#8220;State of Exception&#8221; in response to high levels of extortion and other crimes. The declaration remains in effect and has been modified to include more cities. It allows the police to suspend constitutional rights in 226 of the country&#8217;s 298 municipalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Honduran Ministry of Health declared in June 2024 a national emergency in Honduras due to an increase in dengue cases. The Ministry of Health has carried out dengue prevention, control, and surveillance activities, along with the promotion of preventive measures through the media and educational campaigns. It also carried out clean-up operations and campaigns, including the use of chemical and biological agents for vector control.</p>\n<p>Please review the <a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwwwnc.cdc.gov.mcas.ms%2Ftravel%2Fdestinations%2Ftraveler%2Fnone%2Fhonduras%3Fs_cid%3Dncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </a>(CDC) website and <a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwwwnc.cdc.gov.mcas.ms%2Ftravel%2Fnotices%2Flevel1%2Fdengue-global%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567\">CDC Global Dengue</a> for further information.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Honduras.html\">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Honduras.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Honduras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations.</li>\n<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>\n<li>Avoid walking or driving at night.</li>\n<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>\n<li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.</li>\n<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.</li>\n<li>Do not take public transportation, including white car taxis.

    "description": "\n<p>Exercise increased caution due to the <b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws.</b></p>\n<p><b>Summary:</b> Hong Kong SAR authorities have dramatically restricted civil liberties since the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) imposed the Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR on June 30, 2020. Following the Hong Kong SAR government&#8217;s enactment of its own Safeguarding National Security Ordinance on March 23, 2024, Hong Kong SAR authorities are expected to take additional actions to further restrict civil liberties.</p>\n<p>The 2020 National Security Law outlines a broad range of vaguely defined offenses, such as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance builds on this framework with additional vaguely defined offenses, such as treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage against public infrastructure, and external interference. According to the legislation, these offenses are applicable to foreign nationals within the Hong Kong SAR and to individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, located outside its borders. Under these provisions, anyone who criticizes the PRC and/or Hong Kong SAR authorities may face arrest, detention, expulsion, and/or prosecution. Hong Kong SAR authorities are attempting to enforce these provisions against individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, residing outside their jurisdiction by offering cash rewards for information leading to their arrests in the Hong Kong SAR.</p>\n<p><b>Dual nationality: </b>&nbsp;The Hong Kong SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional security and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen and enter Hong Kong SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In reality, however, U.S. consular officers may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports.

    "description": "\n<p><i><b>Reissued with updates after periodic review.</b></i></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine.&nbsp;</b>The Department of State continues to advise U.S. citizens to not travel to frontline regions of Ukraine and areas along Ukraine&#8217;s border with Belarus due to presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security forces on the Belarusian side of the border, proximity to active ground combat, frequent shelling, missile and drone attacks on populated areas and civilian infrastructure, and limitations on the Embassy&#8217;s ability to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in those areas. Read the entire Travel Advisory.<b></b></p>\n<p><b>Some regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones.</b></p>\n<p><b>Level 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. <br>\n </b>Russia&#8217;s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law.<b></b></p>\n<p>All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications &#8211; which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor &#8211; that announce air alerts in real time, such as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0/id1611955391\">Air Raid Siren</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3/id1617641432\">Alarm Map</a>. The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.</p>\n<p>On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine.

There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s occupation.</p>\n<p>There are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.</p>\n<p>Although Russia&#8217;s occupation severely restricts the Embassy&#8217;s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia &#8211; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ukraine.html\">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Ukraine.</p>\n<p><b>Travel to High-Risk Areas:</b><br>\nIf you choose to travel to Ukraine, you should consider taking the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li>\n<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>\n<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host&nbsp;organization or&nbsp;consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>\n<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.

Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>\n<p>There remains a threat of <b>terrorist attacks </b>in Uganda. Terrorist attacks have occurred, targeting religious venues, schools, and areas frequented by tourists. These attacks have resulted in the deaths of Ugandans as well as foreign visitors. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. ISIS-Central Africa have carried out attacks and claimed responsibility for killing two international tourists and a Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park.</p>\n<p><b>Violent crime</b> -- including armed robbery, home invasion, and sexual assault -- poses a serious threat to visitors and residents in Uganda. These acts can occur at any time, especially in larger cities, including Kampala, Jinja, and Entebbe, as well as the Karamoja region and along Uganda&#8217;s western and northern borders. Police struggle to respond to serious crime in most places due to limited resources.</p>\n<p>The May 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) raises the <b>risk that LGB persons, those perceived to be LGB, or those found to be &#8220;promoting&#8221; LGB could face fines, imprisonment, or the death penalty</b>. They may also face harassment, violence, or attacks by vigilantes or mobs. Under the law, individuals or organizations that &#8220;promote&#8221; LGB human rights could face prosecution. Instances of assault and harassment based on unsubstantiated accusations of supporting the LGB community have occurred throughout the country. The AHA applies to both visitors and residents of Uganda.</p>\n<p><b>Public demonstrations</b> and protests can occur with little to no warning and may increase in frequency around political issues and events such as elections. When protests, strikes, and demonstrations turn unruly, security services are quick to use batons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and gunshots to disperse crowds.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Uganda.html\">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Uganda.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Uganda<b>:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/mpox-drc-neighboring-countries\">CDC&#8217;s webpage</a> on the Mpox outbreak.</li>\n<li>Refer to the <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"https://ug.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-kampala-august-7-2024/\">Embassy Travel Alert&nbsp;page</a> for the latest information on country-specific Mpox information.</li>\n<li>Remain alert and avoid large public gatherings.</li>\n<li>Keep a low profile.</li>\n<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>\n<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.</li>\n<li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.</li>\n<li>Remain with a group of friends in public.</li>\n<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>\n<li>Do not open your door for people at your hotel/residence unless you know who it is.</li>\n<li>Do not leave food and drinks unattended in public, especially in local clubs.</li>\n<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by foreign tourists.</li>\n<li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.</li>\n<li>Enroll in the <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Be mindful that any public identification with or perception as being LGB, as either a member or supporter, could be grounds for prosecution and/or non-state violence.</li>\n<li>Remember that even private, consensual same-sex relations are illegal.</li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/\" adhocenable=\"false\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/TravelGov\" adhocenable=\"false\">X/Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/9a4ec791-65c5-44f1-9261-1c886c70dc9c\">Country Security Report</a> for Uganda.</li>\n<li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html\">Review the Traveler&#8217;s Checklist.</a></li>\n<li>Visit the CDC page for the latest <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list\">Travel Health Information</a> related to your travel.</li>\n<li>Obtain comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</p>\n",

While Egyptian authorities largely conduct effective security oversight, terrorists may attack with little or no warning and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites to include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.</p>\n<p>Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police and security forces. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy may have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens, especially in the case of arrest or detention.

    "title": "Venezuela - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Reissued September 24, 2024, to emphasize the danger to U.S. citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela.</i></b></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to Venezuela due to</b>&nbsp;<b>the high risk of&nbsp;wrongful detentions</b>,&nbsp;<b>terrorism, kidnapping, the&nbsp;arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>civil unrest,</b>&nbsp;<b>poor health infrastructure</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&#8239;</b>&nbsp;In March 2019, the U.S. Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas and suspended operations.&#8239;All consular services, routine and emergency, remain suspended until further notice.&#8239;The U.S. government has no ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. U.S. citizens in Venezuela who require consular assistance should leave the country as soon as safely possible and should contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.</p>\n<p>The Department has determined there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Venezuela. Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years. The U.S. government is not generally notified of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela or granted access to U.S. citizen prisoners there.</p>\n<p>Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common in Venezuela. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Police and security forces have instituted a brutal crackdown on anti-Maduro demonstrations, including the use of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants, and which occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.</p>\n<p>Colombian terrorist groups operate in Venezuela&#8217;s border areas with Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana.</p>\n<p>Shortages of gasoline, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies continue throughout much of Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read the&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html\">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Venezuela.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Venezuela:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a name=\"_Hlk177567081\" id=\"_Hlk177567081\"></a>Avoid travel to Venezuela via any means, including via land border crossings. Nighttime travel between cities or between Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var International Airport and Caracas is unsafe. &nbsp;<a name=\"_Hlk177567032\" id=\"_Hlk177567032\"></a>Entering or attempting to enter Venezuela without a valid Venezuelan visa can lead to indefinite detention without consular access. Visas are not available upon entry.<a name=\"_Hlk177567184\" id=\"_Hlk177567184\"></a> U.S. citizens in Venezuela face a high risk of indefinite detention without consular access.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>U.S. citizens in Venezuela should draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>U.S. citizens in Venezuela should develop a communication plan with family and/or an employer or host organization. A plan should include a &#8220;proof of life&#8221; protocol with loved ones so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>\n<li>U.S. citizens&#8217; contingency plans for travel to Venezuela should not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li>\n<li>The U.S. government cannot assist U.S. citizens in Venezuela in replacing lost or expired travel documents.</li>\n<li>Travelers face an increased risk using unregulated taxis from the Maiquetia &#8220;Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var&#8221; International Airport and ATMs in the area.</li>\n<li>U.S. citizens in Venezuela should consider hiring a professional security organization.</li>\n<li>Over the counter and prescription medicines are unlikely to be available to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.</li>\n<li>The U.S. government will not be able to assist should the need for a medical emergency or evacuation arise.

    "title": "Haiti - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated to reflect additional information on crime.</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Haiti due to <b>kidnapping</b>, <b>crime</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, and <b>limited health care.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Since March 2024, Haiti has been under a State of Emergency. Crimes involving firearms are common in Haiti. They include robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom. Kidnapping is widespread, and U.S. citizens have been victims and have been hurt or killed. Kidnappers may plan carefully or target victims at random, unplanned times. Kidnappers will even target and attack convoys. Kidnapping cases often involve ransom requests. Victims&#8217; families have paid thousands of dollars to rescue their family members.&#8239;</p>\n<p>Protests, demonstrations, and roadblocks are common and unpredictable. They often damage or destroy infrastructure and can become violent. Mob killings and assaults by the public have increased, including targeting those suspected of committing crimes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The airport in Port-au-Prince can be a focal point for armed activity. Armed robberies are common. Carjackers attack private vehicles stuck in traffic. They often target lone drivers, especially women. As a result, the U.S. embassy requires its staff to use official transportation to and from the airport.</p>\n<p>Do not cross the border by land between Haiti and the Dominican Republic due to the threat of kidnapping and violence. These dangers are present on roads from major Haitian cities to the border. The U.S. embassy cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic by air, land, or sea.&#8239;&#8239;U.S. citizens who cross into the Dominican Republic at an unofficial crossing may face high immigration fines if they try to leave. The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about security in the ports of Haiti. Until those are addressed, the Coast Guard advises mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Haiti to exercise caution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti. Local police and other first responders often lack the resources to respond to emergencies or serious crime. Shortages of gasoline, electricity, medicine, and medical supplies are common throughout the country. Public and private medical clinics and hospitals often lack trained staff and basic resources. In addition, they require prepayment for services in cash.</p>\n<p>U.S. government personnel are subjected to a nightly curfew and are prohibited from walking in Port-au-Prince. Personnel movement is restricted throughout Haiti. U.S. government personnel in Haiti are also prohibited from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Visiting banks and using ATMs.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Driving at night.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Traveling anywhere after dark.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Traveling without prior approval and special security measures in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Haiti.html#:~:text=Do%20Not%20Travel.-,Avoid%20all%20international%20travel%20due%20to%20the%20global%20impact%20of,robbery%20and%20carjacking%2C%20is%20common.&amp;text=Demonstrations%2C%20tire%20burning%2C%20and%20roadblocks,unpredictable%2C%20and%20can%20turn%20violent.\">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Haiti.&#8239;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:&#8239;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Do not attempt to drive through roadblocks.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Do not give personal information to unauthorized people to include those without uniforms or credentials. Individuals with bad intent may frequent areas at the airport, including near immigration and customs.&#8239;</li>\n<li>If you are being followed as you leave the airport, drive to the nearest police station immediately.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Travel by vehicle to reduce walking in public.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Travel in groups or at least do not travel alone.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Always keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Be cautious and alert. This is especially important when driving through markets and other crowded areas.&#8239;</li>\n<li>Do not fight back during a robbery.

Attacks have been rare since the announcement of a truce between Saudi Arabia, the Houthi rebels, and the internationally recognized Government of Yemen. Recent Houthi attacks have focused on vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. The Houthis have also threatened to renew attacks against Saudi Arabia.

    "description": "\n<p><b>Reissued after periodic review with updates for Chiapas, and Durango.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Violent crime &#8211; such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery &#8211; is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico, as travel by U.S. government employees to certain areas is prohibited or restricted. In many states, local emergency services are limited outside the state capital or major cities.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens are advised to adhere to restrictions on U.S. government employee travel. State-specific restrictions are included in the individual state advisories below. U.S. government employees may not travel between cities after dark, may not hail taxis on the street, and must rely on dispatched vehicles, including app-based services like Uber, and regulated taxi stands. U.S. government employees should avoid traveling alone, especially in remote areas. U.S. government employees may not drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to or from the interior of Mexico, except daytime travel within Baja California and between Nogales and Hermosillo on Mexican Federal Highway 15D, between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey on Highway 85D and between Ciudad Juarez and interior cities as noted in the Chihuahua section.<br>\n<br>\nRead the&nbsp;<a

    "description": "\n<p><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of <b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping,</b>&nbsp;<b>arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens and&nbsp;wrongful detentions</b>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>U.S. citizens should not travel to Iran for any reason.</p>\n<p>Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. nationals, particularly dual U.S.-Iranian nationals--including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics--on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals and consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.</p>\n<p>Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

    "title": "Libya - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated risk indicators, and the &#8220;If you decide to travel&#8221; section.</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Libya due to <b>crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, </b>and<b> armed conflict.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.</p>\n<p><b>Terrorist groups</b> are present in Libya. No terrorist incidents that involved foreigners have been publicly reported in Libya since 2015. &nbsp;Nevertheless, terrorist attacks could occur with little or no warning, targeting public spaces like tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.</p>\n<p><b>Kidnapping</b> is widespread, and victims have included U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Criminal or armed individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release.</p>\n<p><b>Unexploded landmines, </b>cluster munitions, and unexploded ammunition are a hazard throughout Libya. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Landmines do exist in populated areas due to numerous ground offensives in the last decade.</p>\n<p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, and Zuwara, have witnessed fighting among armed groups. Hotels and airports frequented by U.S. citizens have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p>\n<p>Armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or a legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning.&nbsp; The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise caution.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens in Libya in need of routine consular services should contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia for assistance. To contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"https://tn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens who are in Libya are urged to depart as soon as possible via commercial means if possible. U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"mailto:TunisACS@state.gov\">TunisACS@state.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>The Department of State will continue to provide information via the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), Embassy Libya's web page, Travel.State.Gov, Facebook, and Twitter/X.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Libya.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Libya.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Libya:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times.</li>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>\n<li>Make contingency plans to leave.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or a power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etcetera.</li>\n<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your family, and employer or host organization, so that they can monitor your safety and location.

Read the entire Travel Advisory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b> Violent crime occurs throughout Jamaica. Tourist areas generally see lower rates of violent crime than other parts of the country. The homicide rate reported by the Government of Jamaica is among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Armed robberies and sexual assaults are common.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy routinely receives reports of sexual assaults, including from U.S. citizen tourists at resorts. U.S. citizens report slow or unsatisfactory response to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a final verdict and sentence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care available in Jamaica as is available in the United States. This includes generally lower levels of emergency service response times or routine care for illness or injury. Private hospitals require payment up front before admitting patients and may not have the ability to provide specialized care. Ambulance services are not always staffed with EMTs or always readily available, especially in rural areas. U.S. citizens should bring extra prescription medication as common medications such as insulin can be difficult to obtain.</p>\n<p><b>We strongly encourage you to obtain traveler&#8217;s insurance, including medical evacuation insurance, before traveling.&nbsp;<u>The Department of State does not pay medical bills.</u></b></p>\n<p><u>U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated with changes to security information.</i></b></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to</b> Somalia due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism</b>,<b> civil unrest, health issues, kidnapping, piracy, and lack of availability of routine consular services.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia. Illegal roadblocks are widespread.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Somalia because there is no permanent consular officer in Somalia, including the Somaliland region.<b> If a traveler&#8217;s passport is lost, stolen, or expires, or the traveler becomes destitute</b> the U.S. government may be unable to assist.</p>\n<p>Some schools and other facilities act as &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; centers and &#8220;de-westernization&#8221; camps. These facilities exist throughout Somalia with little or no licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse are common. People also report being held against their will in these facilities.</p>\n<p>There are frequent reports of U.S. citizens who have their passports taken by family members, leaving them unable to depart Somalia. This often occurs when U.S. citizens travel to Somalia to visit family or attend an event. Some adult U.S. citizens are then unable to leave the international airport without explicit consent from their family.</p>\n<p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting airports, seaports, and government buildings. Terrorists also target hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other places that attract large crowds and tourists. Government, military, and other convoys, including those carrying tourists are also targets. Methods of attack can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and rocket fire, among others. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning. The U.S. Embassy imposes strict limits on employee movement in Mogadishu based on the critical threat environment.</p>\n<p>Civil unrest, including protests and demonstrations, occurs throughout Somalia and can sometimes be violent.</p>\n<p>Medical facilities in Somalia have limited capacity and are often absent in rural areas.</p>\n<p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially off the coast of Puntland.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation.&nbsp; For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/somalia-travel-advisory.html/#ExternalPopup\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Somalia.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Somalia.</p>\n<p><b>If you decide to travel to Somalia:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Make a plan to exit Somalia if the situation gets worse.

    "title": "Russia - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><i><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></i></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to Russia</b> due to the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces. U.S. citizens may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the possibility of terrorism. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia. The Department has determined that there is a continued risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by Russian authorities. <b>U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should leave immediately.</b></p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy is operating with reduced staffing, and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. Furthermore, all U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services.</p>\n<p>There have been reports of drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine as well as in Moscow, Kazan, and St. Petersburg. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.</p>\n<p>Russia may refuse to recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has denied consular officers visits to detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens. The Russian government has forced citizens with dual nationality to join the Russian military and prevented them from leaving the country. In 2022, the Russian government mobilized citizens for its invasion of Ukraine. Military conscription continues.</p>\n<p>In Russia, the rights to peaceful assembly and free speech are not always protected. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who joined protests. Moreover, there are many reports of Russians being detained for social media posts.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should know that U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the U.S. to Russia is nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>Commercial flight options are minimal and are often unavailable on short notice.&nbsp;If you wish to depart Russia, you should make independent arrangements. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in leaving the country, and transportation options may suddenly become even more restricted.</p>\n<p>Click&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/informationforuscitizeninrussia.html\">here</a>&nbsp;for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.</p>\n<p>U.S. Embassy staff generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns. Recently, the FAA downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2. Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights in some Russian areas, including the Moscow Flight Information Region (FIR), the Samara FIR (UWWW), and the Rostov-na-Donu (URRV) FIR within 160NM of the boundaries of the Dnipro (UKDV) Flight Information Regions. Check the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#RussianFederation\">FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>Russian officials have interrogated and threatened U.S. citizens without cause. This includes former and current U.S. government and military personnel and private U.S. citizens engaged in business. U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.</p>\n<p>Russian authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen and may delay U.S. consular assistance. Russian security services also target foreign and international organizations they consider &#8220;undesirable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges, denied them fair treatment, and convicted them without credible evidence. Furthermore, Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to Russia.</p>\n<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar. Under martial law, authorities can set curfews, seize property, and restrict movement. The Russian government may detain foreigners, forcibly relocate residents, and limit public gatherings. U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to these areas.</p>\n<p>Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for &#8220;acting against Russia's interests.&#8221; Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting &quot;anti-Russian&quot; groups and punished individuals for criticizing the government or military. The Russian government's current &quot;LGB propaganda&quot; law bans discussion of LGB related topics. In November 2023, the Supreme Court labeled the so-called &quot;international LGB movement&quot; as extremist. This decision effectively made it a crime to support the human rights of LGB persons in Russia.</p>\n<p>Terrorists continue to plan attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident proved they can strike suddenly. Terrorists may target tourist areas, transport hubs, and markets. They may also target government buildings, hotels, clubs, restaurants, and places of worship. Parks, events, schools, and airports are also potential targets.&nbsp; U.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are not permitted to travel to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to those areas.</p>\n<p>The international community does not recognize Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea and does not acknowledge Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea and there is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas. There is intense fighting across these regions and Russian authorities there have abused both foreigners and locals. Authorities have specifically targeted individuals who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s authority.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv administers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the conflict limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Russia.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Russia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the information on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html\">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas</a>.</li>\n<li>Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.- Russian nationality.</li>\n<li>Have a contingency plan in place that does not rely on U.S. government help.

The development of a professional tourist police corps, institution of a 911 system in many parts of the country, and a concentration of resources in resort areas means these tend to be better policed than urban areas like Santo Domingo.

    "description": "\n<p><b>Updated Country Summary, to include information about implementation of a conscription law, and changes to the &#8220;<i>If you decide to travel to Burma&#8221;</i> section.</b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest, armed conflict, and arbitrary enforcement of local laws</b>. Reconsider travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources, and areas with land mines and unexploded ordnances</b>. Exercise increased caution due to&nbsp;<b>wrongful detentions</b>.</p>\n<p><b>COUNTRY SUMMARY:&nbsp;</b>The Burma military regime detained and deposed elected government officials in a February 2021 coup d'&#233;tat. Protests and demonstrations against military rule continue, often on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests by&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily detaining individuals</b>&nbsp;and with the indiscriminate use of deadly force against protesters and bystanders.</p>\n<p>The Department of State has determined that the&nbsp;<b>risk of wrongful detention</b>&nbsp;of U.S. nationals by the military regime exists.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Burma due to security concerns amidst the ongoing armed conflict. This may be of particular concern to crime victims outside of Rangoon.</p>\n<p>To mitigate safety and security risks, U.S. government employees&#8217; dependents, under the age of 21, cannot reside in Burma with their U.S. government parent assigned to work in Burma.</p>\n<p><b>Civil unrest&nbsp;and armed conflict</b>&nbsp;occur throughout Burma. The level of&nbsp;civil unrest and armed conflict&nbsp;varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time.</p>\n<p>Civil unrest and armed violence due to fighting between the military regime and various ethnic groups and militias occur particularly in parts of Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine, and Shan States, as well as in Sagaing and Magway regions.</p>\n<p>Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are used in the ongoing armed conflicts, including within the greater Rangoon area. From January to December 2023, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of fifteen IEDs per month detonated against regime targets, while an average of eight unexploded IEDs were discovered and safely disposed of per month by security authorities. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and other critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>While <b>land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)&nbsp;exist throughout Burma</b>, NGOs working on this issue state the greatest concerns are in Shan, Chin, and Kachin State. The locations of landmines and UXO are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable.</p>\n<p>The military regime&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily enforces local laws</b>, including <b>often </b>detaining individuals<b> without respect for their fair trial guarantees or other applicable rights</b>. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained and regime authorities could deny access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement officials may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime. Facebook and X (Twitter) are banned in Burma. Police have sought bribes from individuals using a virtual private network (VPN) to access social media sites even though VPN use is legal.</p>\n<p>Burma has&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources</b>&nbsp;due to critical staffing shortages in the public sector health workforce. Importation of medical supplies, including medicine, into Burma is not consistent and medical prescriptions and over-the-counter medicine may not be available.</p>\n<p>Burma&#8217;s <b>military conscription law</b> was first introduced in 2010 but historically was not widely implemented. The military regime officially implemented the law in April 2024. In general, Burmese males aged 18 to 35 and Burmese females aged 18 to 27 will need to register for military service and report for duty if ordered by regime authorities. Burmese males aged 18 to 45 and Burmese females aged 18 to 35 in specific expert/professional occupations must serve if called upon by the regime.

Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outside of Ecuador&#8217;s major towns and cities, much of the country&#8217;s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas.</p>\n<p><b>Land Border Restrictions</b>: All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the <a href=\"https://www.turismo.gob.ec/requisitos-de-ingreso-al-ecuador-continental-e-islas-galapagos/\">Ministry of Tourism&#8217;s webpage</a> and at <a href=\"https://ecuador.travel/viaja-seguro/\">Ecuador.Travel</a>.

    "description": "\n<p><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></p>\n<p>Reconsider travel to Papua New Guinea due to <b>crime, civil unrest,</b> and <b>piracy</b>. Exercise increased caution due to <b>kidnapping, unexploded ordnance, inconsistent availability of healthcare services, and potential for natural disasters.</b> Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Central Bougainville, particularly areas near the Panguna mine, due to&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>.</li>\n<li>The Highlands region, other than the towns of Mt. Hagen and Goroka, due to <b>civil unrest</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b> <b>Violent crime</b>, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, and armed robberies, is common. There have been reports of criminals attacking resorts popular with foreign tourists to steal goods and money. Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to <b>civil unrest</b> involving violence and can occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including the central part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt. Hagen), Eastern Highlands (excluding Goroka), Hela, Enga, Jiwaka, and other areas of Papua New Guinea where one is unable to fly directly.</p>\n<p><b>Piracy</b> is active in the waters surrounding Papua New Guinea. Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back.</p>\n<p>Visit our website on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/internl-maritime-piracy-robbery.html\">International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Kidnapping</b> for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign citizen was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign citizens employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Travelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of <b>unexploded ordnance (UXO)</b> remaining from World War II. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.</p>\n<p>Papua New Guinea has<b> inconsistent availability of healthcare services</b> which may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.</p>\n<p>Papua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes.

The government of Mauritania does not maintain a substantial presence in these areas and thus police are unable to respond to most incidents there. In addition, cell phone coverage and paved roads are nonexistent. U.S. officials are unable to travel to these places.
