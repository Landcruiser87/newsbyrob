Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals and consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.</p>\n<p>Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The U.S. government is unable to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Iran.</p>\n<p>Companies offering surrogacy services in Iran are misrepresenting the security situation in Iran and the risks of the unregulated surrogacy tourism industry. Private companies that arrange such visits and services put U.S. citizens in danger.</p>\n<p>Due to the risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Iran, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

    "description": "\n<p>Updated to reflect Level 4: Do Not Travel and the Department&#8217;s ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and family members.</p>\n<p>Do not travel to Bangladesh due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest, crime, </b>and <b>terrorism</b>.<br>\n</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>On August 5, 2024, the Department ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and family members. Travelers should not travel to Bangladesh due to ongoing&nbsp;civil unrest&nbsp;in Dhaka. Violent clashes have occurred in the city of Dhaka, its neighboring areas, and throughout Bangladesh, and the Bangladeshi Army is deployed nationwide. Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport temporarily paused operations on August 5. Travelers should check with their airlines to confirm status for future flights.</p>\n<p>Travelers should be aware of petty&nbsp;<b>crimes</b>&nbsp;such as pickpocketing in crowded areas. Crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute the majority of criminal activity in Bangladesh&#8217;s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality. These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.</p>\n<p><b>Terrorist attacks</b>&nbsp;can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities.</p>\n<p>Because of security concerns U.S. Embassy personnel in Bangladesh are subject to some movement and travel restrictions. The U.S. government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Bangladesh due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bangladesh.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Bangladesh:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and political gatherings.</li>\n<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust plans.</li>\n<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.

Kidnappings have occurred in the region, including those motivated by domestic or familial disputes, and those targeting members of religious minorities. Separatist organizations and political violence also pose additional threats to visitors to the region, and there have been recent instances of IED explosions and active shooting.

    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated risk indicators, and the &#8220;If you decide to travel&#8221; section.</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Libya due to <b>crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, </b>and<b> armed conflict.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.</p>\n<p><b>Terrorist groups</b> are present in Libya. No terrorist incidents that involved foreigners have been publicly reported in Libya since 2015. &nbsp;Nevertheless, terrorist attacks could occur with little or no warning, targeting public spaces like tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.</p>\n<p><b>Kidnapping</b> is widespread, and victims have included U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Criminal or armed individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release.</p>\n<p><b>Unexploded landmines, </b>cluster munitions, and unexploded ammunition are a hazard throughout Libya. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Landmines do exist in populated areas due to numerous ground offensives in the last decade.</p>\n<p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, and Zuwara, have witnessed fighting among armed groups. Hotels and airports frequented by U.S. citizens have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p>\n<p>Armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or a legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning.&nbsp; The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise caution.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens in Libya in need of routine consular services should contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia for assistance. To contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"https://tn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens who are in Libya are urged to depart as soon as possible via commercial means if possible. U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to <a adhocenable=\"false\" href=\"mailto:TunisACS@state.gov\">TunisACS@state.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>The Department of State will continue to provide information via the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), Embassy Libya's web page, Travel.State.Gov, Facebook, and Twitter/X.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Libya.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Libya.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Libya:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times.</li>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>\n<li>Make contingency plans to leave.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or a power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etcetera.</li>\n<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your family, and employer or host organization, so that they can monitor your safety and location.

    "description": "\n<p><b>Updated to raise the Travel Advisory to Level 4: Do Not Travel, due to rising tensions between Hizballah and Israel.</b></p>\n<p>Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to <b>rising tensions between Hizballah and Israel</b>. If you are in Lebanon, be prepared to shelter in place should the situation deteriorate. The U.S. Embassy strongly encourages U.S. citizens who are already in Southern Lebanon, near the borders with Syria, and/or in refugee settlements to depart.</p>\n<p>Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to <b>crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, unexploded landmines, and the risk of armed conflict</b>. Some areas, especially near the borders, have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;Country Summary: U.S. citizens already in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and review their personal security plans.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens in Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p>\n<p>Since October 8, Hizballah has conducted attacks against Israel that have escalated in recent weeks, culminating in a July 27 rocket attack on Majdal Shams, a town in the Golan Heights, which killed 12 children. This strike has increased the risk of further escalation between Hizballah and Israel.</p>\n<p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning.</p>\n<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p>\n<p>Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated.</p>\n<p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.</p>\n<p>Unexploded landmines and explosive remnants of war are a hazard along the border with Syria. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as these have the potential to turn violent quickly and with little notice. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport.</p>\n<p>Read the&#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Lebanon.html\">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Lebanon.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Lebanon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for information on &#8239;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped, or taken hostage.</li>\n<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li>\n<li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.</li>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>\n<li>Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners.</li>\n<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.</li>\n<li>Enroll in the&#8239;<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&#8239;(<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/\" title=\"TravelGov\" adhocenable=\"false\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TravelGov\" title=\"TravelGov\" adhocenable=\"false\">Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the&#8239;<a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report\">Country Security Report</a>&#8239;for Lebanon.</li>\n<li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list\" title=\"CDC- Destinations\" adhocenable=\"false\">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li>\n<li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Private hospitals require payment up front before admitting patients and may not have the ability to provide specialized care. Ambulance services are not always staffed with EMTs or always readily available, especially in rural areas.

    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated with changes to security information.</i></b></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to</b> Somalia due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism</b>,<b> civil unrest, health issues, kidnapping, piracy, and lack of availability of routine consular services.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia. Illegal roadblocks are widespread.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Somalia because there is no permanent consular officer in Somalia, including the Somaliland region.<b> If a traveler&#8217;s passport is lost, stolen, or expires, or the traveler becomes destitute</b> the U.S. government may be unable to assist.</p>\n<p>Some schools and other facilities act as &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; centers and &#8220;de-westernization&#8221; camps. These facilities exist throughout Somalia with little or no licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse are common. People also report being held against their will in these facilities.</p>\n<p>There are frequent reports of U.S. citizens who have their passports taken by family members, leaving them unable to depart Somalia. This often occurs when U.S. citizens travel to Somalia to visit family or attend an event. Some adult U.S. citizens are then unable to leave the international airport without explicit consent from their family.</p>\n<p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting airports, seaports, and government buildings. Terrorists also target hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other places that attract large crowds and tourists. Government, military, and other convoys, including those carrying tourists are also targets. Methods of attack can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and rocket fire, among others. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning. The U.S. Embassy imposes strict limits on employee movement in Mogadishu based on the critical threat environment.</p>\n<p>Civil unrest, including protests and demonstrations, occurs throughout Somalia and can sometimes be violent.</p>\n<p>Medical facilities in Somalia have limited capacity and are often absent in rural areas.</p>\n<p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially off the coast of Puntland.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation.&nbsp; For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/somalia-travel-advisory.html/#ExternalPopup\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Somalia.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Somalia.</p>\n<p><b>If you decide to travel to Somalia:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Make a plan to exit Somalia if the situation gets worse.

    "title": "Syria - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Updated to reflect the risk of wrongful detention</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Syria due to the risk of&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping or hostage taking, and armed conflict. </b>Exercise increased caution due to the risk of <b>wrongful detention. </b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&#8239;The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. Czechia serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria.</p>\n<p>Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Hostage taking by armed groups, wrongful detentions, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment of civilian centers pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. The U.S. government does not support this activity. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, wrongful detentions, injury, or death. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.</p>\n<p>Protests and demonstrations are quelled by government forces through aggressive tactics and protestors, activists, and political dissenters are routinely detained without access to legal representation or the ability to communicate with friends and family.</p>\n<p>Terrorist groups are active in Syria. Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, IEDs, and assassinations. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism or a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p>\n<p>There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. U.S. citizens are also targets of abduction and/or wrongful detention by the Syrian government. Those in detention do not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where widespread cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Minors, persons with physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, and elderly have frequently been victims of unjust detention. The Syrian government has also been implicated in the enforced or involuntary disappearance of more than 100,000 individuals, including medical and humanitarian workers, journalists, human rights activists, political opposition, and additionally those suspected of affiliation with these groups and their family members. Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.</p>\n<p>Due to risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

    "description": "\n<p><b>Updated to reflect additional information on terrorism and security.</b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Yemen due to <b>terrorism, civil unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, </b>and<b> landmines</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy in Sana&#8217;a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Yemen.</p>\n<p>The Department of State has designated Ansarallah, commonly referred to as the Houthis, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. Other terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State affiliates, continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen &#8211; most notably in al-Bayda, Abyan, and Shabwah governorates. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of foreign organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.</p>\n<p>A civil war continues in Yemen. While reduced overall levels of violence continue following the April 2022 truce, instability, and ongoing threats of armed conflict, particularly along the frontlines in central Yemen, remain at a severe level. Due to the ongoing civil unrest and weak government institutions, travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities. Foreign nationals are frequently the target of kidnapping and carjacking, particularly when traveling outside of urban areas.</p>\n<p>Military conflict has caused destruction of basic infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities. This destruction limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care in affected areas. It also often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water. Landmines exist throughout Yemen.</p>\n<p>Widespread violent crime and/or organized crime are present in Yemen. Local law enforcement may have limited or no ability or willingness to respond to serious crimes.</p>\n<p>As a result of the deterioration of health services, Yemen is experiencing the re-emergence of infectious diseases, such as cholera, polio, and measles. There is a limited availability of medicine and medical supplies, and adequate medical treatment is unavailable.</p>\n<p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping and detention of U.S. citizens in Yemen, particularly dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens. U.S. citizens, particularly young people, are also at risk of kidnapping for purposes of forced marriage, sometimes involving force, fraud, or coercion by family members in the United States and/or Yemen. The Houthis, who control Sana&#8217;a, have detained U.S. citizens, including dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens. U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty &#8211; including lengthy delays &#8211; when attempting to depart Yemen.</p>\n<p>Commercial flights have departed from Aden and Sana&#8217;a to multiple destinations in the region. Contact airlines and travel companies directly for the most current information on flights departing Yemen.</p>\n<p>Companies outside of Yemen have misrepresented the security situation on the Yemeni island of Socotra. They offer tourist visits, including by facilitating unofficial and invalid &quot;visas.&quot; Only the sovereign Republic of Yemen government can issue valid Yemeni visas. Companies that arrange such visits are putting tourists in danger, including legal jeopardy. While security conditions may be less volatile than on the mainland, the U.S. government has no presence and no way to assist U.S. citizens who travel there. U.S. citizens should not travel to Socotra or any other part of Yemen.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Due to risks to commercial shipping operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen territorial waters, the Department of Transportation&#8217;s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has issued a Maritime Advisory. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href=\"https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal\">Maritime Administration&#8217;s Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI)</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen&#8217;s ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen.

    "description": "\n<p><i><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></i></p>\n<p><b>Do not travel to Russia</b> due to the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces. U.S. citizens may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the possibility of terrorism. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia. The Department has determined that there is a continued risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by Russian authorities. <b>U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should leave immediately.</b></p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy is operating with reduced staffing, and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. Furthermore, all U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services.</p>\n<p>There have been reports of drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine as well as in Moscow, Kazan, and St. Petersburg. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.</p>\n<p>Russia may refuse to recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has denied consular officers visits to detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens. The Russian government has forced citizens with dual nationality to join the Russian military and prevented them from leaving the country. In 2022, the Russian government mobilized citizens for its invasion of Ukraine. Military conscription continues.</p>\n<p>In Russia, the rights to peaceful assembly and free speech are not always protected. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who joined protests. Moreover, there are many reports of Russians being detained for social media posts.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should know that U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the U.S. to Russia is nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>Commercial flight options are minimal and are often unavailable on short notice.&nbsp;If you wish to depart Russia, you should make independent arrangements. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in leaving the country, and transportation options may suddenly become even more restricted.</p>\n<p>Click&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/informationforuscitizeninrussia.html\">here</a>&nbsp;for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.</p>\n<p>U.S. Embassy staff generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns. Recently, the FAA downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2. Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights in some Russian areas, including the Moscow Flight Information Region (FIR), the Samara FIR (UWWW), and the Rostov-na-Donu (URRV) FIR within 160NM of the boundaries of the Dnipro (UKDV) Flight Information Regions. Check the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#RussianFederation\">FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>Russian officials have interrogated and threatened U.S. citizens without cause. This includes former and current U.S. government and military personnel and private U.S. citizens engaged in business. U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.</p>\n<p>Russian authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen and may delay U.S. consular assistance. Russian security services also target foreign and international organizations they consider &#8220;undesirable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges, denied them fair treatment, and convicted them without credible evidence. Furthermore, Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to Russia.</p>\n<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar. Under martial law, authorities can set curfews, seize property, and restrict movement. The Russian government may detain foreigners, forcibly relocate residents, and limit public gatherings. U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to these areas.</p>\n<p>Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for &#8220;acting against Russia's interests.&#8221; Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting &quot;anti-Russian&quot; groups and punished individuals for criticizing the government or military. The Russian government's current &quot;LGBT propaganda&quot; law bans discussion of LGBTQI+ related topics. In November 2023, the Supreme Court labeled the so-called &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as extremist. This decision effectively made it a crime to support the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Russia.</p>\n<p>Terrorists continue to plan attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident proved they can strike suddenly. Terrorists may target tourist areas, transport hubs, and markets. They may also target government buildings, hotels, clubs, restaurants, and places of worship. Parks, events, schools, and airports are also potential targets.&nbsp; U.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are not permitted to travel to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to those areas.</p>\n<p>The international community does not recognize Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea and does not acknowledge Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea and there is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas. There is intense fighting across these regions and Russian authorities there have abused both foreigners and locals. Authorities have specifically targeted individuals who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s authority.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv administers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the conflict limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Russia.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Russia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the information on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html\">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas</a>.</li>\n<li>Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.- Russian nationality.</li>\n<li>Have a contingency plan in place that does not rely on U.S. government help.

    "title": "Burma (Myanmar) - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b>Updated Country Summary, to include information about implementation of a conscription law, and changes to the &#8220;<i>If you decide to travel to Burma&#8221;</i> section.</b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest, armed conflict, and arbitrary enforcement of local laws</b>. Reconsider travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources, and areas with land mines and unexploded ordnances</b>. Exercise increased caution due to&nbsp;<b>wrongful detentions</b>.</p>\n<p><b>COUNTRY SUMMARY:&nbsp;</b>The Burma military regime detained and deposed elected government officials in a February 2021 coup d'&#233;tat. Protests and demonstrations against military rule continue, often on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests by&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily detaining individuals</b>&nbsp;and with the indiscriminate use of deadly force against protesters and bystanders.</p>\n<p>The Department of State has determined that the&nbsp;<b>risk of wrongful detention</b>&nbsp;of U.S. nationals by the military regime exists.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Burma due to security concerns amidst the ongoing armed conflict. This may be of particular concern to crime victims outside of Rangoon.</p>\n<p>To mitigate safety and security risks, U.S. government employees&#8217; dependents, under the age of 21, cannot reside in Burma with their U.S. government parent assigned to work in Burma.</p>\n<p><b>Civil unrest&nbsp;and armed conflict</b>&nbsp;occur throughout Burma. The level of&nbsp;civil unrest and armed conflict&nbsp;varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time.</p>\n<p>Civil unrest and armed violence due to fighting between the military regime and various ethnic groups and militias occur particularly in parts of Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine, and Shan States, as well as in Sagaing and Magway regions.</p>\n<p>Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are used in the ongoing armed conflicts, including within the greater Rangoon area. From January to December 2023, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of fifteen IEDs per month detonated against regime targets, while an average of eight unexploded IEDs were discovered and safely disposed of per month by security authorities. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and other critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>While <b>land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)&nbsp;exist throughout Burma</b>, NGOs working on this issue state the greatest concerns are in Shan, Chin, and Kachin State. The locations of landmines and UXO are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable.</p>\n<p>The military regime&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily enforces local laws</b>, including <b>often </b>detaining individuals<b> without respect for their fair trial guarantees or other applicable rights</b>. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained and regime authorities could deny access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement officials may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime. Facebook and X (Twitter) are banned in Burma. Police have sought bribes from individuals using a virtual private network (VPN) to access social media sites even though VPN use is legal.</p>\n<p>Burma has&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources</b>&nbsp;due to critical staffing shortages in the public sector health workforce. Importation of medical supplies, including medicine, into Burma is not consistent and medical prescriptions and over-the-counter medicine may not be available.</p>\n<p>Burma&#8217;s <b>military conscription law</b> was first introduced in 2010 but historically was not widely implemented. The military regime officially implemented the law in April 2024. In general, Burmese males aged 18 to 35 and Burmese females aged 18 to 27 will need to register for military service and report for duty if ordered by regime authorities. Burmese males aged 18 to 45 and Burmese females aged 18 to 35 in specific expert/professional occupations must serve if called upon by the regime. For more information, please refer to the Myanmar People&#8217;s Military Service Law (State Peace and Development Council Law No. 27/2010), also known as the Public Military Service Law. The military regime may refuse to acknowledge U.S.-Burmese dual nationals&#8217; U.S. citizenship, prevent their departure from Burma, and/or conscript them into the military. U.S.-Burmese nationals should consider this issue before traveling to Burma.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Burma.html\">Country Information page</a> for additional information on travel to Burma.</p>\n<p><b>If you decide to travel to Burma:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)&nbsp;</a>to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/\">Facebook&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/travelgov\">Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Follow the Embassy on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usembassy.rangoon/\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/USEmbassyBurma?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Follow the Embassy&#8217;s Consular Section on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/consularrangoon/\">Facebook</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report\">Country Security Report&nbsp;</a>for Burma.</li>\n<li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list\">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Purchase travel medical insurance that covers Burma and includes medical evacuation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Make contingency plans to leave the country.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Review local laws and conditions before traveling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Review our website on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html\">Dual-Nationality</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html\">High-Risk Area Travelers</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Review <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/financial-preparedness\">Ready.gov&#8217;s Financial Preparedness webpage</a>.</li>\n<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization.</li>\n<li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices prior to travel.</li>\n</ul>\n",

U.S. citizens in Venezuela who require consular assistance should try to leave the country as soon as safely possible to do so and should contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country. </p>\n<p>Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common in Venezuela. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Anti-Maduro demonstrations have elicited a strong police and security force response, including the use of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants, and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.

    "title": "Iraq - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b>Updated to reflect the termination of Ordered Departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and eligible family members.</b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Iraq due to <b>terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and Mission Iraq&#8217;s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.</b></p>\n<p>On April 1, 2024, the Department terminated the Ordered Departure status for U.S. Embassy Baghdad and U.S. Consulate General Erbil. However, the Travel Advisory level for Iraq remains at Level 4, advising that U.S. citizens not travel to Iraq.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks to their safety and security, including the potential for violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad and other major cities. In an emergency, consular services to U.S. citizens in Iraq are limited due to severe restrictions on the movements of U.S. government personnel.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turning violent.</p>\n<p>Do not travel near Iraq&#8217;s northern borders due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest. U.S. citizens should especially avoid areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with aerial strikes by neighboring countries&#8217; militaries.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of or supporting designated terrorist organizations is a crime under U.S. law that can result in prison sentences and large fines in the United States.</p>\n<p>Because of security concerns, U.S. government personnel in Baghdad are instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport. Due to risks to civil aviation operating in the Baghdad Flight Information Region, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has extended its Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) prohibiting certain flights at altitudes below 32,000 feet for an additional two years. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#Iraq\">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.</a></p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iraq.html\">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Iraq.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Iraq:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li>\n<li>Visit our website for <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Enroll in the <a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StateDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report\">Country Security Report</a> for Iraq.</li>\n<li>Visit the CDC website for the latest <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list\">Travel Health Information</a> related to your travel.</li>\n<li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outside of Ecuador&#8217;s major towns and cities, much of the country&#8217;s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas.</p>\n<p><b>Land Border Restrictions</b>: All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the <a href=\"https://www.turismo.gob.ec/requisitos-de-ingreso-al-ecuador-continental-e-islas-galapagos/\">Ministry of Tourism&#8217;s webpage</a> and at <a href=\"https://ecuador.travel/viaja-seguro/\">Ecuador.Travel</a>.

    "description": "\n<p>Exercise increased caution due to the&nbsp;<b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Summary:</b>&nbsp;Hong Kong SAR authorities have dramatically restricted civil liberties since the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) imposed the Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR on June 30, 2020. Following the Hong Kong SAR government&#8217;s enactment of its own Safeguarding National Security Ordinance on March 23, 2024, Hong Kong SAR authorities are expected to take additional actions to further restrict civil liberties.</p>\n<p>The 2020 National Security Law outlines a broad range of vaguely defined offenses, such as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance builds on this framework with additional vaguely defined offenses, such as treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage against public infrastructure, and external interference. According to the legislation, these offenses are applicable to foreign nationals within the Hong Kong SAR and to individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, located outside its borders. Under these provisions, anyone who criticizes the PRC and/or Hong Kong SAR authorities may face arrest, detention, expulsion, and/or prosecution. Hong Kong SAR authorities are attempting to enforce these provisions against individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, residing outside of their jurisdiction by offering cash rewards for information leading to their arrests in the Hong Kong SAR.</p>\n<p><b>Dual Nationality:</b>&nbsp;The Hong Kong SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen and enter Hong Kong SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In practice, however, U.S. consular officers may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports.

Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to <b>civil unrest</b> involving violence and can occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including the central part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt. Hagen), Eastern Highlands (excluding Goroka), Hela, Enga, Jiwaka, and other areas of Papua New Guinea where one is unable to fly directly.</p>\n<p><b>Piracy</b> is active in the waters surrounding Papua New Guinea. Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back.</p>\n<p>Visit our website on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/internl-maritime-piracy-robbery.html\">International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Kidnapping</b> for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign citizen was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign citizens employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Travelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of <b>unexploded ordnance (UXO)</b> remaining from World War II. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.</p>\n<p>Papua New Guinea has<b> inconsistent availability of healthcare services</b> which may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.</p>\n<p>Papua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes.

    "description": "\n<p><b><i>Last Update: Updated to reflect the Ordered Departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and eligible family members for Embassy Port-au-Prince.</i></b></p>\n<p>Do not travel to Haiti due to&nbsp;kidnapping,&nbsp;crime, civil unrest, and poor health care infrastructure. On July 27, 2023, the Department of State ordered the departure of family members of U.S. government employees and non-emergency U.S. government employees. U.S. citizens in Haiti should depart Haiti as soon as possible by commercial or other privately available transportation options, in light of the current security situation and infrastructure challenges. U.S. citizens wishing to depart Port-au-Prince should monitor local news and only do so when considered safe.</p>\n<p><b>Country Summary</b>: Kidnapping is widespread, and victims regularly include U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may use sophisticated planning or take advantage of unplanned opportunities, and even convoys have been attacked. Kidnapping cases often involve ransom negotiations and U.S. citizen victims have been physically harmed during kidnappings. Victim&#8217;s families have paid thousands of dollars to rescue their family members.</p>\n<p>Violent crime, often involving the use of firearms, such as &nbsp;armed robbery, carjackings, and kidnappings for ransom that include U.S. citizens are common. Mob killings against presumed criminals have been on the rise since late April. Travelers are sometimes followed and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. Robbers and carjackers also attack private vehicles stuck in heavy traffic congestion and often target lone drivers, particularly women. As a result, the U.S. Embassy requires its personnel to use official transportation to and from the airport.</p>\n<p>Protests, demonstrations, tire burning, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent. The U.S. government is extremely limited in its ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Haiti &#8211; assistance on site is available only from local authorities (Haitian National Police and ambulance services). Local police generally lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Shortages of gasoline, electricity, medicine, and medical supplies continue throughout much of Haiti. Public and private medical clinics and hospitals often lack qualified medical staff and even basic medical equipment and resources.</p>\n<p>U.S. government personnel are limited only to the confined area around the Embassy and are prohibited from walking in Port-au-Prince. U.S. government personnel in Haiti are prohibited from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis</li>\n<li>Visiting banks and using ATMs</li>\n<li>Driving at night</li>\n<li>Traveling anywhere between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.</li>\n<li>Traveling without prior approval and special security measures in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Haiti.html#:~:text=Do%20Not%20Travel.-,Avoid%20all%20international%20travel%20due%20to%20the%20global%20impact%20of,robbery%20and%20carjacking%2C%20is%20common.&amp;text=Demonstrations%2C%20tire%20burning%2C%20and%20roadblocks,unpredictable%2C%20and%20can%20turn%20violent.\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Haiti.</p>\n<p>The Haitian Ministry of Health and Population (MSPP) has confirmed an outbreak of cholera in the country. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.

    "description": "\n<p><b>Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.</b></p>\n<p>Reconsider travel to El Salvador due to&nbsp;<b>crime.</b></p>\n<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador (GOES) declared a &#8220;State of Exception&#8221; in response to an increase in homicides. The declaration remains in effect. The State of Exception grants authorities power to arrest anyone suspected of gang activity and suspends several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure such as the right to a speedy trial. Prison conditions are harsh. Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception, some in a reportedly arbitrary manner. Under its Territorial Control Plan, the GOES also may, without prior warning, restrict access via checkpoints to areas suspected of gang activity. U.S. citizens are advised that access to and freedom of movement within these areas may be limited.</p>\n<p>Though there has been a significant reduction in gang-related activity, violent crime remains a concern throughout significant portions of the country. Crime rates vary among departamentos (states) and municipios (municipalities), and areas witnessing higher crime rates are often located in close proximity to lower crime areas or must be crossed in moving between lower risk areas. Local authorities may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents, although the concentration of resources in resort areas means these areas tend to be better policed than urban areas.</p>\n<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/ElSalvador.html\">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to El Salvador.</p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to El Salvador:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>\n<li>Do not walk outside after dark.

    "title": "Ukraine - Level 4: Do Not Travel",
    "description": "\n<p><b>Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine.</b> The Department of State continues to advise that U.S. citizens not travel to Ukraine due to active armed conflict. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>\n<p>All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. Those choosing to remain in Ukraine should exercise caution due to the potential for military attacks, crime, civil unrest, and consult the Department&#8217;s latest security alerts.</p>\n<p>The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable. U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.</p>\n<p>There are continued reports of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.</p>\n<p>U.S. citizens seeking emergency assistance should email <a href=\"mailto:KyivACS@state.gov\">KyivACS@state.gov</a> for assistance. Please review <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html\">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas</a>. U.S. citizens may also seek consular services, including requests for repatriation loans, passports, and visa services, at <a href=\"https://www.usembassy.gov/\">U.S. embassies and consulates in neighboring countries</a>.</p>\n<p>On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each province (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.</p>\n<p>Many in the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in these areas. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s occupation.</p>\n<p>Although Russia&#8217;s ongoing war against Ukraine severely restricts the Embassy&#8217;s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia &#8211; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#8211; to the extent possible given security conditions.</p>\n<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions\">Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ukraine.html\">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Ukraine.</p>\n<p><b>Travel to High-Risk Areas</b></p>\n<p>If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and travel to Ukraine, you should consider taking the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Visit our website on <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html\">Travel to High-Risk areas</a>.</li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li>\n<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>\n<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host&nbsp;organization or&nbsp;consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>\n<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.
